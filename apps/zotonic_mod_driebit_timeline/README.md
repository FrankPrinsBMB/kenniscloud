# Setup

-   The current javascript file will only work if you use the same class names on the content of the cards:

    -   c-timeline\_\_item
    -   c-timeline
    -   c-timeline\_\_line
    -   c-timeline-card
    -   c-timeline\_\_dot

-   There is also the stylsheet used for setting this up on Kenniscloud included which can be used as inspiration or directly included in the style.scss of the destination project.

-   TODO:
    -   https://gitlab.driebit.nl/driebit/kenniscloud/-/merge_requests/971 (lots of notes from the merge request)
